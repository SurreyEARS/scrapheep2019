This year's challenge involves creating a robot which is able to complete a course in the fastest possible time. A black line along the course has been provided to help guide the robot.

## How to win
The team which completes the course in the fastest possible time will be crowned the winner.
* Time will be measured from the marked start line to the point when the robot reaches a finishing zone.
    * If a team manages to finish in Finish Zone 2 instead of Finish Zone 1, they will be awarded 20 bonus seconds which will be subtracted from their overall time.

## Judges and Organisers
* The organisers are not allowed to assist the teams with completion of the challenge in any way. 
    * This includes helping building contraptions or dropping useful hints.
* Organisers are not allowed to take part in the event as a contestant.
* Decisions made by the organisers and judges are final and cannot be argued by the teams.
