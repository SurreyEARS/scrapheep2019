# Course Overview
![An overview of the course](https://github.com/JrLynn/scraphEEp2019/blob/5dba90f7361811a2e414731bff5daf3ecae34ff5/CourseLayout/Overall%20Layout.JPG)
Although the only requirement is that competitors travel from the start zone to a finish zone, a course is provided for their convenience. The course consists of several features, including:
- Ramps (up and down)
- Tunnel
- Bridge
- Seesaw
- Jump

The course route is marked with a continuous black line, laid on top of white paper 

 ## The Start Zone

Competitors will place their devices in this yellow marked zone in order to start the course.

Competitors are faced with the option of two routes to take from the start zone.
1. The first involves a climb up a steep metal ramp, followed by trip down a very very steep ramp into the midpoint of the tunnel.
2. The second involves an extended curved route on level ground to the tunnel entrance.

## The Tunnel

The first obstacle which must be tackled by the robots is a tunnel. This tunnel has a fixed height and width and on competition day, the inside of the tunnel will be lined with LED lighting.

The image above shows the entrance to the tunnel. Partway down the tunnel the down ramp to be used by robots taking route 1 is visible.
